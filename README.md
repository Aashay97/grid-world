# Grid World

A simple grid world with obstacles. Has your standard value iteration to find the optimal policy. 

We also have an agent that interacts with the noisy environment and performs Q-Learning. 

Plus there is an implementation of potential-based reward shaping as proposed in [this paper](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/courses/games/AIpapers/ml99-shaping.pdf) by Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999).
